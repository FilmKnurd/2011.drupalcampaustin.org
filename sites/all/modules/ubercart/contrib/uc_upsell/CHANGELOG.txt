CHANGELOG.txt

9/3/2009 - v.6.x-1.16
-----------------
- Changed handler for product images. It's configured now to use either the node-type default,
  or the Ubercart default of "uc_product" unless something else is configured in the Upsell settings.
  NOTE: If your images are now showing up, or with the incorrect Imagecache preset, check this first!
- Added "one-to-one" and "one-to-many" options in the way reciprocals are associated.
- Changed products selected by the node edit form so that they take precedence over related-by-
  taxonomy products in the event that both exist in the array.
- Fixed some issues with product classes.

6/12/2009
---------
- Added $context information and changed formatting to use uc_price.
- Credit belongs to sammys and longwave for their patch contributions!


4/26/2009
---------
- Fixed the array_merge issues that appeared when a product had no related nodes, or when submitting
a node form with an empty Related Products list.
- Refactored some of the code involving related nodes by taxonomy.
- Added / changed some logic to updating related products - now instead of associating Product A
with Product B, it associates all of Product A's related products, along with Product A, to Product B - creating a many-to-many relationship, instead of 1 to many.

4/25/2009
---------
Fixed some issues with logic and products not displaying correctly, cart pane not showing at all,
etc.
Also broke up the module into additional include files, separating the logic from the admin,
cart pane, and block sections. This will allow for better code maintenance going forward.


4/10/2009
---------
Added additional CSS classes; removed 'content' div.
Fixing issues related to random products showing in block instead of Related products.
Removed ending punctuation for Customer Message on product Block
Added hook_nodeapi to allow simple insertion of Upsell block into .tpl.php files.

3/27/2009
---------
Removed 'upid' field from schema and changed primary key to 'nid'. Removed the table {uc_upsell_nodetypes}.


3/23/2009
---------
Fixed bugs involved in the configuration settings:
 - Default config taken out of $GLOBALS, since that was causing issues
 - Moved default settings into hook_init and out of hook_menu

Imagecache 2.x compatibility:
 - UC Upsell is now no longer compatible with Imagecache 1.x (since this is no longer recommended for D5).


3/11/2009
---------
Fixed a bug where unpublished nodes could still show up if they had been previously selected by the Related Products
  select list, but had since been unpublished. Filtering happens in the same function as the node->type filter.

2/26/2009
---------
Added configuration settings for selecting certain node types to show in the Related Products form during Node Edit
  These settings affect the products that are displayed in the cart / product blocks as well.
  For instance, if you have products of both Foo and Bar selected in the product's form, and then change the config
  settings to only show products of type Bar, any products of type Foo will no longer be shown in the Edit form OR
  in the product page or the cart page.

Added configurable imagecache preset: This allows store admins to choose which preset they would like to use from
  Imagecache as their thumbnail preset globally. TODO: Make this context-sensitive, perhaps an additional preset for
  cart page vs. preset for product or other node pages.
