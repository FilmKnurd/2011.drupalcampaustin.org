INTRODUCTION

Current Maintainer: Dave Reid <http://drupal.org/user/53892>
Project Page: http://drupal.org/project/admin_links

This is a very simple module that adds the content local tabs (Edit, Delete,
Revisions, etc.) as links to teasers/lists of nodes. It also makes the Delete
link show up as a tab in the individual node view just like the Edit and View
tabs (Drupal 6+ only).

This module also provides support for the Universal Edit Button, a green pencil
icon in the address bar that indicates a web page is editable. It is similar to
the orange "broadcast" RSS icon that indicates there is an RSS feed available.
For more information and to download the Universal Edit Button browser
extension, visit http://universaleditbutton.org/.
